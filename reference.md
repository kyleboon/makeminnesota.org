(It’s not a drop-in public workshop; activities are structured as classes or sponsored sessions.)

- **Maker Meetups and Events:** Various nonprofits and volunteer groups support the maker community through events. For instance, organizations have hosted **Mini Maker Faires** and maker expos in Minnesota (the Twin Cities hosted full-fledged Maker Faires in past years, and smaller events like **Maker Fair Minnesota** in St. Peter celebrate local artisans and crafters). These events, often run by volunteers or education nonprofits, provide makers with venues to showcase projects, learn from each other, and inspire the public – helping grow the maker movement at the grassroots level ([Makerspace Movement - Minnesota Children's Museum](https://mcm.org/makerspace-movement/#:~:text=A%20maker%20space%2C%20also%20known,become%20more%20accessible%20and%20available)) ([Makerspace Movement - Minnesota Children's Museum](https://mcm.org/makerspace-movement/#:~:text=As%20the%20maker%20space%20movement,doors%20to%20success%20are%20opened)). (*While events are not physical resources, they are key community-building initiatives for makers in Minnesota.*)

- **Community Education Programs:**  Many city and county community education departments (often affiliated with public school districts) run maker-focused programs or clubs. For example, **Minneapolis Community Ed** has offered adult classes in 3D printing and electronics, **Rochester Public Library** hosts a teen makerspace program, and **Willmar’s GLARS** (Great Lakes Aerospace Science & Education Center) features a makerspace for youth. These initiatives, typically nonprofit or government-funded, aim to broaden access to maker skills and tools at a local level.

## Startup Incubators and Prototyping Support

- **Launch Minnesota (State of MN – DEED)** – *Launch MN* is a statewide initiative to accelerate startups and innovation, spearheaded by the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development. It offers **Innovation Grants up to $35,000** to promising early-stage businesses to cover R&D, prototyping, product development, and other operational costs ([MN: Launch Minnesota Awards Nearly $583,000 to 21 Innovative Startups  | Trade and Industry Development](https://www.tradeandindustrydev.com/region/minnesota/news/mn-launch-minnesota-awards-nearly-583000-21-33590#:~:text=Launch%20Minnesota%20is%20a%20statewide,business%20expenses%20and%20technical%20assistance)). Since its inception in 2019, Launch Minnesota has awarded millions in grants, with a focus on inclusive entrepreneurship (over 60% of grant recipients have been founders in greater MN or from underrepresented groups) ([MN: Launch Minnesota Awards Nearly $583,000 to 21 Innovative Startups  | Trade and Industry Development](https://www.tradeandindustrydev.com/region/minnesota/news/mn-launch-minnesota-awards-nearly-583000-21-33590#:~:text=The%20Minnesota%20Department%20of%20Employment,are%20located%20in%20Greater%20Minnesota)) ([MN: Launch Minnesota Awards Nearly $583,000 to 21 Innovative Startups  | Trade and Industry Development](https://www.tradeandindustrydev.com/region/minnesota/news/mn-launch-minnesota-awards-nearly-583000-21-33590#:~:text=Since%20its%20inception%20in%202019%2C,award%20funding)).

- **Enterprise Minnesota (Manufacturing Extension Partnership)** – Enterprise Minnesota is a nonprofit consulting organization chartered as Minnesota’s official **Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP)** affiliate. Its mission is to help small and medium-sized manufacturers across the state to compete and grow. For makers and small-scale manufacturers, Enterprise Minnesota can provide expertise in areas like process improvement, quality management (ISO certification), and even technology adoption (they have helped companies implement additive manufacturing/3D printing capabilities) ([Enterprise Minnesota Helps RedEye Put 3D Printing In The Sky | NIST](https://www.nist.gov/blogs/manufacturing-innovation-blog/enterprise-minnesota-helps-redeye-put-3d-printing-sky#:~:text=In%20December%2C%20I%20wrote%20about,in%20the%20aerospace%20industry%20too)) ([Enterprise Minnesota Helps RedEye Put 3D Printing In The Sky | NIST](https://www.nist.gov/blogs/manufacturing-innovation-blog/enterprise-minnesota-helps-redeye-put-3d-printing-sky#:~:text=since%20learned%20that%20the%20MEP,in%20the%20aerospace%20industry%20too)). They publish the *Enterprise Minnesota Magazine* and conduct an annual State of Manufacturing survey. **Website:** [enterpriseminnesota.org](https://www.enterpriseminnesota.org). *Support Offered:* Business consultations, workshops, and hands-on projects (fees often subsidized by state/federal funds due to MEP program).

- **Incubators & Accelerators with Prototyping Resources:** Minnesota is home to several startup incubators and accelerators that assist hardware makers and product developers in moving from prototype to production. For example, **gener8tor** runs a gBETA Medtech accelerator in Minneapolis (with access to lab space through partners), and the **University Enterprise Laboratories (UEL)** in St. Paul provides wet labs and light manufacturing space for biotech and medtech startups. **Meda** (Metropolitan Economic Development Association) offers a BIPOC business accelerator that has helped entrepreneurs set up small production operations. While these organizations are not makerspaces open to the public, they do support makers transitioning into manufacturing by providing workspace, mentorship, and sometimes funding. Checking in with regional innovation hubs like **Forge North** (a Twin Cities startup coalition) can point new entrepreneurs to available prototyping labs, incubator programs, or fabrication resources geared toward startups.

- **Small Batch Manufacturing Support:**  Beyond formal incubators, Minnesota has resources for entrepreneurs who need to produce short runs of products. **Protolabs** (based in Maple Plain) and **Fastenal’s Cold Spring** prototyping center are private companies that offer quick-turn prototyping and low-volume manufacturing services using CNC, injection molding and 3D printing. For a maker-turned-business needing 10–1000 units, these services can bridge the gap before full-scale manufacturing. In addition, initiatives like the **Minnesota SBIR/STTR Accelerator** (through MN Technology Association) help tech inventors secure federal R&D grants to fund prototype development. Connecting with these resources can significantly help a maker project evolve into a marketable product.
